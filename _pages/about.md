Hanwen Zhang(张瀚文)
</p>
I am a master's candidate in [Robotics, Automation, Perception & Decision Laboratory](http://lab.sysu-robotics.com)(RAPID Lab) of Sun Yat-sen Universit (2022-Present), supervised by Prof. [Cheng Hui](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2504). The main thesis of my master's degree is real-time dense mapping. I visited the [STAR Lab](http://sysu-star.com) and worked under the guidance of Prof. [Boyu Zhou](https://boyuzhou.net)(周博宇) in 2023. 

Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from Northeast Agricultural University (2018-2022), majoring in agricultural mechanization and automation (Honors class). During my undergraduate study, I joined the electromechanical Laboratory led by Prof. [Longzhe Quan](https://jsxx.ahau.edu.cn/ch/jsxx_show.html?zgh=2021156)(权龙哲) and served as the leader of the artificial Intelligence Group, where I worked on weeding robots and identification of seedlings and grasses.

Research Interests
======
My research interests primarily focus on **enabling robots to autonomously and in real-time construct highly accurate, high-fidelity, and highly complete maps**. Specifically, this includes the following areas:
