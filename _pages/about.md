I am a master's candidate in Robotics, Automation, Perception & Decision Laboratory(RAPID Lab) of Sun Yat-sen University (2022-present), supervised by Prof. Cheng Hui. The main thesis of my master's degree is real-time dense mapping. I visited the STAR Lab and worked under the guidance of Prof. Boyu Zhou in 2023. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from Northeast Agricultural University(2018-2022), majoring in agricultural mechanization and automation (Honors class). During my undergraduate study, I joined the electromechanical Laboratory led by Prof. Longzhe Quan and served as the leader of the artificial Intelligence Group, where I worked on weeding robots and identification of seedlings and grasses.
